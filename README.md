1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.

Answer: No because this feature is quite a complex feature that has multiplie working components that would be too ambiguous to test. It isn't specific enough for us to test individual cases as there is many aspects.

1) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.

Answer: Yes because this test case is quite a simple feature to check and relies on a small function. Due to its specificity, it makes this check perfect for unit testing.
